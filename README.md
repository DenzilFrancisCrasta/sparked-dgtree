# Distributed-DGTree
DGTree : A tree index to facilitate subgraph isomorphism queries on large graph databases. Given a large database of data-graphs and a query graph we look to find a list of datagraphs subgraph isomorphic to the query graph.

We provide a distributed implemntation of DGTree (DOI: 10.1109/ICDE.2016.7498237) in Apache Spark.
